## String Membership

### Exercise 4: Check String Membership
**Task:** Test whether a given sequence of characters can be found in a string.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a string `text` with any value.
2. Check if a specific word or character exists in the string using the `in` keyword.

## Concatenating Strings

### Exercise 5: Concatenate Two Strings
**Task:** Concatenate one string to another string.

**Instructions:**
1. Create two strings, `string1` and `string2`, with any values.

**Task:** Create and print a raw string literal and a Unicode string literal.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a raw string `raw_string` using the `r` prefix.
2. Create a Unicode string `unicode_string` using the `u` prefix.
3. Print both strings.

---

## Comparing Strings

### Exercise 8: Compare Two Strings
**Task:** Compare two strings to check if they are equal.

**Instructions:**
1. Create two strings, `string1` and `string2`, with any values.

## String Methods

### Exercise 9: Utilize String Methods
**Task:** Use various string methods to manipulate a string.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a string `my_string` with any value.
2. Convert the string to lowercase using the `lower()` method and print the result.
3. Convert the string to uppercase using the `upper()` method and print the result.
4. Strip leading and trailing whitespace using the `strip()` method and print the result.

6. Find the position of a substring using the `find()` method and print the result.
7. Check if the string starts with a specific substring using the `startswith()` method and print the result.
8. Check if the string ends with a specific substring using the `endswith()` method and print the result.
