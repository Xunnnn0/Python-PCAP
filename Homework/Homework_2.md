## Section 2: Short Answer / Definitions

**Problem 1:** Explain the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop. Provide an example where each would be appropriate to use.

**Problem 2:** Write a function definition for a function that takes two arguments, a string and a character, and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.

**Problem 3:** Describe what a nested loop is and provide an example.

**Problem 4:** Explain what the `break` and `continue` statements do in a loop. Provide an example of each.

**Problem 5:** Write a short explanation of what list comprehension is and provide an example that creates a list of the first 10 even numbers.

**Problem 6:** Explain the difference between mutable and immutable types in Python. Provide examples of each.

## Section 3: Coding Challenges

**Problem 1:** Calculate the Sum of Even Numbers
- Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a `while` loop.
- **Hint:** Use a condition to check if a number is even and a loop to iterate through the numbers.

**Problem 2:** Print a Pattern
- Use a `for` loop to print the following pattern:
  ```
  *
  **
  ***
  ****
  *****
  ```
- **Hint:** Use nested loops to manage the number of stars per line.

**Problem 3:** Password Authentication
- Write a program that allows a user to input a password up to three times. If the correct password is entered, print "Access Granted". If all three attempts are wrong, print "Access Denied".
- **Hint:** Use a `for` loop with a `break` statement and an `else` clause.

**Problem 4:** FizzBuzz
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
- **Hint:** Use the modulus operator `%` to check for multiples and `if-elif-else` statements inside a loop.

**Problem 5:** Palindrome Checker
- Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- **Hint:** Use string slicing to reverse the string and compare it to the original.

**Problem 6:** Count Vowels
- Write a function to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
- **Hint:** Use a loop to iterate through the string and a counter to keep track of vowels.

**Problem 7:** List Comprehension
- Create a list of the squares of the first 10 positive integers using list comprehension.
- **Hint:** Use the `range` function inside the list comprehension.

**Problem 8:** Common Elements
- Write a function that takes two lists and returns a new list containing only the elements that are common to both lists.
- **Hint:** Use a `for` loop and an `if` condition to check for common elements.

**Problem 9:** Factorial Function
- Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.
- **Hint:** Use a `for` loop or `while` loop to calculate the factorial.

**Problem 10:** Fibonacci Sequence
- Write a function that prints the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Hint:** Use a loop to generate the sequence, starting with the first two numbers (0 and 1).

**Problem 11:** Calculate the Hypotenuse
- Write a function that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides using the `math` module.
- **Hint:** Use `math.sqrt()` and `math.pow()`.

**Problem 12:** Calculate the Area of a Circle
- Write a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius using the `math` module.
- **Hint:** Use `math.pi`.

**Problem 13:** Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
- Write a function that finds the GCD of two numbers using the `math` module.
- **Hint:** Use `math.gcd()`.

**Problem 14:** Generate Random Numbers
- Write a function that generates a list of `n` random numbers between a given range using the `random` module.
- **Hint:** Use `random.randint()`.

**Problem 15:** Calculate the Exponential
- Write a function that calculates the exponential of a given number using the `math` module.
- **Hint:** Use `math.exp()`.
